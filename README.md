# Mockito Scala library

The library is a one-stop shop for using Mockito in Scala language.

## Why separate project?

The library has independent developers, release cycle and versioning from core mockito library (https://github.com/mockito/mockito). This is intentional because core Mockito developers don't use Scala and cannot confidently review PRs, and set the vision for the Scala library.
